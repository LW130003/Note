# The Project Object Model

Maven projects, dependencies, builds, artifacts: all of these objects are to be modeled and described. These objects are described by an XML file called a Project Object Model. The POM tells Maven what sort of project it is dealing with and how to modify default behavior to generate output from source. In the same way a Java web application has a *web.xml* that describes, configures, and customizes the application, a Maven project is defined by the presence of a *pom.xml*. It is a descriptive declaration of a project for Maven; it is the figurative "map" that Maven needs to understand what it is looking at when it builds your project.
