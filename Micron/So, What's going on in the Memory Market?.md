# ‘So, What's Going on in the Memory Markets?’

## Why This Matters
- The good news is that there is no need to panic over the current memory market situation.
- The overall demand for memory products is increasing in non-flagship phones.
- Customer inventory supply of memory is improving.

“Now With Dave” is a quarterly series with Micron Chief Financial Officer Dave Zinsner. This is the first of four installments on the topics Zinsner covered in his Q1 FY19 Now With Dave webcast.

There are a few things going on that are driving the weakness in the memory markets. The biggest contributing factor to the current market slump is inventory adjustments that are happening at some of our customers.

Throughout 2018, DRAM was in tight supply, making prices high. During this time, many of our customers built up their own inventories of DRAM. They do this to ensure they can provide products to their own customers in the event DRAM supply becomes even more restricted. As the supply of DRAM increased, our customers began to adjust their inventory. There are two ways they can do this:
•Use the inventory of DRAM and NAND they have on-hand
•Build their products from new shipments Micron is sending them

If they take both approaches, they need fewer components from Micron, which is the case currently.

The good news: There’s no need to panic. As our customers reduce their inventories, they’ll need more new shipments from Micron, normalizing the current imbalance. Micron’s expectation is that by the end of 2019, those inventory adjustments will be complete, and demand for our products will begin to rebound.

The second industry trend contributing to the current market slowdown is a CPU shortage at Intel. Because Intel cannot ship enough CPUs to meet demand, computers cannot be built, so there isn’t as much need for memory. Eventually Intel will catch up and fix its supply challenges.

Third, as reported by various media outlets, high-end smartphones phones from the world’s two largest smartphone companies haven’t been selling as well as expected. Because smartphones use our products, this affects us.

However, 5G cellular networks coming online in the coming years will create a compelling reason to upgrade to a newer handset. The overall demand for memory products in cell phones also continues to increase. So even if handset volume remains steady, more memory going into these phones will continue to drive bit growth.
