# Spark SQL, DataFrames and Datasets Guide
https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.2.0/sql-programming-guide.html

# Getting Started
## 1. Starting Point: SparkSession
### Python
```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

spark = SparkSession \
    .builder \
    .appName("Python Spark SQL basic example") \
    .config("spark.some.config.option", "some-value") \
    .getOrCreate()
```

## 2. Creating DataFrames
### Python
```python
# spark is an existing SparkSession
df = spark.read.json("examples/src/main/resources/people.json")
# Displays the content of the DataFrame to stdout
df.show()
# +----+-------+
# | age|   name|
# +----+-------+
# |null|Michael|
# |  30|   Andy|
# |  19| Justin|
# +----+-------+
```
### 3. Untyped Dataset Operations (aka DataFrame Operations)
R
In Python it’s possible to access a DataFrame’s columns either by attribute (df.age) or by indexing (df['age']). While the former is convenient for interactive data exploration, users are highly encouraged to use the latter form, which is future proof and won’t break with column names that are also attributes on the DataFrame class.
```python
# spark, df are from the previous example
# Print the schema in a tree format
df.printSchema()
# root
# |-- age: long (nullable = true)
# |-- name: string (nullable = true)

# Select only the "name" column
df.select("name").show()
# +-------+
# |   name|
# +-------+
# |Michael|
# |   Andy|
# | Justin|
# +-------+

# Select everybody, but increment the age by 1
df.select(df['name'], df['age'] + 1).show()
# +-------+---------+
# |   name|(age + 1)|
# +-------+---------+
# |Michael|     null|
# |   Andy|       31|
# | Justin|       20|
# +-------+---------+

# Select people older than 21
df.filter(df['age'] > 21).show()
# +---+----+
# |age|name|
# +---+----+
# | 30|Andy|
# +---+----+

# Count people by age
df.groupBy("age").count().show()
# +----+-----+
# | age|count|
# +----+-----+
# |  19|    1|
# |null|    1|
# |  30|    1|
# +----+-----+
```
## 4. Running SQL Queries Programmatically
```python
# Register the DataFrame as a SQL temporary view
df.createOrReplaceTempView("people")

sqlDF = spark.sql("SELECT * FROM people")
sqlDF.show()
# +----+-------+
# | age|   name|
# +----+-------+
# |null|Michael|
# |  30|   Andy|
# |  19| Justin|
# +----+-------+
```

## 5. Global Temporary View
```python
# Register the DataFrame as a global temporary view
df.createGlobalTempView("people")

# Global temporary view is tied to a system preserved database `global_temp`
spark.sql("SELECT * FROM global_temp.people").show()
# +----+-------+
# | age|   name|
# +----+-------+
# |null|Michael|
# |  30|   Andy|
# |  19| Justin|
# +----+-------+

# Global temporary view is cross-session
spark.newSession().sql("SELECT * FROM global_temp.people").show()
# +----+-------+
# | age|   name|
# +----+-------+
# |null|Michael|
# |  30|   Andy|
# |  19| Justin|
# +----+-------+
```

# Interoperating with RDDs
Spark SQL supports two different methods for converting existing RDDs into Datasets. The first method uses reflection to infer the schema of an RDD that contains specific types of objects. This reflection based approach leads to more concise code and works well when you already know the schema while writing your Spark application.

The second method for creating Datasets is through a programmatic interface that allows you to construct a schema and then apply it to an existing RDD. While this method is more verbose, it allows you to construct Datasets when the columns and their types are not known until runtime.

## 1. Inferring the Schema Using Reflection
Spark SQL can convert an RDD of Row objects to a DataFrame, inferring the datatypes. Rows are constructed by passing a list of key/value pairs as kwargs to the Row class. The keys of this list define the column names of the table, and the types are inferred by sampling the whole dataset, similar to the inference that is performed on JSON files.
```python
from pyspark.sql import Row

sc = spark.sparkContext

# Load a text file and convert each line to a Row.
lines = sc.textFile("examples/src/main/resources/people.txt")
parts = lines.map(lambda l: l.split(","))
people = parts.map(lambda p: Row(name=p[0], age=int(p[1])))

# Infer the schema, and register the DataFrame as a table.
schemaPeople = spark.createDataFrame(people)
schemaPeople.createOrReplaceTempView("people")

# SQL can be run over DataFrames that have been registered as a table.
teenagers = spark.sql("SELECT name FROM people WHERE age >= 13 AND age <= 19")

# The results of SQL queries are Dataframe objects.
# rdd returns the content as an :class:`pyspark.RDD` of :class:`Row`.
teenNames = teenagers.rdd.map(lambda p: "Name: " + p.name).collect()
for name in teenNames:
    print(name)
# Name: Justin
```

## 2. Programatically Specifying Schema

When a dictionary of kwargs cannot be defined ahead of time (for example, the structure of records is encoded in a string, or a text dataset will be parsed and fields will be projected differently for different users), a DataFrame can be created programmatically with three steps.
1. Create an RDD of tuples or lists from the original RDD;
2. Create the schema represented by a StructType matching the structure of tuples or lists in the RDD created in the step 1.
3. Apply the schema to the RDD via createDataFrame method provided by SparkSession.
For example:
```python
# Import data types
from pyspark.sql.types import *

sc = spark.sparkContext

# Load a text file and convert each line to a Row.
lines = sc.textFile("examples/src/main/resources/people.txt")
parts = lines.map(lambda l: l.split(","))
# Each line is converted to a tuple.
people = parts.map(lambda p: (p[0], p[1].strip()))

# The schema is encoded in a string.
schemaString = "name age"

fields = [StructField(field_name, StringType(), True) for field_name in schemaString.split()]
schema = StructType(fields)

# Apply the schema to the RDD.
schemaPeople = spark.createDataFrame(people, schema)

# Creates a temporary view using the DataFrame
schemaPeople.createOrReplaceTempView("people")

# SQL can be run over DataFrames that have been registered as a table.
results = spark.sql("SELECT name FROM people")

results.show()
# +-------+
# |   name|
# +-------+
# |Michael|
# |   Andy|
# | Justin|
# +-------+
```
